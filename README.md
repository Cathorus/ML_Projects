# ML_Projects 🧠🔥

Welcome to the ML_Projects repository! This repository contains some of my practice machine learning projects. The projects cover various topics, including:

- 🖼 Image classification using CNNs
- 💬 Natural language processing
- 📈 Regression
- 🗺 Clustering
- ✂️ Dimensionality reduction
- 📚 Recommendation systems

💡 The main objective of these projects is for me to practice and strengthen my machine learning skills. My goals with these projects are to:

- 🧪 Experiment with different ML algorithms ⚙️
- 👩‍💼 Implement models from scratch
- 📚 Utilize popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
- 
## Topics Explored

The projects cover a diverse range of topics, allowing me to explore various areas within machine learning, such as:

- 🔢 Regression algorithms
- 📊 Classification algorithms
- 🗺️ Clustering algorithms
- ✂️ Dimensionality reduction techniques
- 📚 Recommender systems
- 💬 Natural Language Processing
- ⏰ Time series analysis
- 🚀 Anomaly detection
- ⚙️ Optimization algorithms

📄 Most of the code in this repository is well-documented and includes instructions on how to run and use the models. I will continue adding more practice projects to this repository over time.

Feel free to check out the projects and learn from the code. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome! 😄

Happy exploring and learning! 🚀
